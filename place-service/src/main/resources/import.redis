The tower also lost its standing as the world’s tallest tower to the Tokyo Tower in 1958 but retains its status as the tallest freestanding (non-guyed) structure. The Eiffel tower is a puddled iron structure, an iron that has lost some of its carbon and therefore rusts less quickly. It is pyramidal in shape with slightly curved sides.
